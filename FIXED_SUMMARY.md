# 🔧 **COMPACT SINGLE-SPEAKER FIXES APPLIED**

## 🎯 **What I Fixed - Round 2**

### **Issue: Old CSS Interfering with New System**
**Problem**: The old dialogue-bubble system CSS was still active, causing interference with the new single-speaker layout.

**Root Cause**: Multiple CSS systems were competing:
- Old: `dialogue-bubble-container`, `avatar-container`, `message-card`  
- New: `single-line-container`, `single-line-view`, `speech-bubble`

### **CSS Fixes Applied**

✅ **Disabled Old Message Cards**:
```css
.message-card {
    display: none !important;
}
.message-card::before {
    display: none !important;
}
```

✅ **Disabled Old Dialogue Bubbles**:
```css
.dialogue-bubble-container {
    display: none !important;
}
```

✅ **Disabled Old Avatar Containers**:
```css
.avatar-container {
    display: none !important;
}
.avatar-ring {
    display: none !important;
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing Status**

### **What Should Now Work**:
1. **Main Game**: http://localhost:8000/
   - Old CSS styles are now disabled
   - Only new single-speaker system should render
   - One avatar + one speech bubble at a time

2. **Working Demo**: http://localhost:8000/debug-working.html  
   - Shows perfect example of how it should look
   - Compact 72px avatars with speech bubbles

### **Expected Behavior**:
✅ **Single speech bubble** appears next to one avatar  
✅ **Space/Enter** advances to next speaker  
✅ **Compact 72px avatars** (56px on mobile)  
✅ **Villa background** remains visible  
✅ **Progress indicator** shows current position  

## 🔍 **If Still Not Working**

The fixes should have resolved the CSS interference. If the layout is still wrong, the issue is likely:

1. **JavaScript Error**: Check browser console for errors
2. **Old Rendering Code**: Still creating wrong HTML structure  
3. **Cache Issue**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) to clear CSS cache

### **Debug Steps**:
1. Open http://localhost:8000/
2. Click "🏝️ Enter the Villa"  
3. Make a choice to trigger reactions
4. **Check browser console** for:
   - "SINGLE-LINE STORY MODE ACTIVE"
   - "Parsing reaction: ..." logs
   - "STEP { id: ..., type: 'say', speakerId: ... }"
   - Any JavaScript errors

### **What to Look For**:
- **Right-click** on reactions area and "Inspect Element"
- Should see: `<div class="single-line-container">` 
- Should NOT see: `<div class="dialogue-bubble-container">`

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

The game should now show:
- **One compact avatar** (72px circle with character ring)
- **One speech bubble** beside it with tail pointing to avatar
- **Character name** in bold at top of bubble
- **One line of dialogue** below the name
- **Progress indicator** at bottom
- **Villa background** visible behind content

**No more**: Multiple stacked bubbles, oversized elements, or white feed cards.

The compact single-speaker system is now properly isolated from the old system!
