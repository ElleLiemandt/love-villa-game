# **📖 Day 3: Romance or Ruin (Sample Script)**

### **Opening Narration (Ariana)**

* *“It’s Day 3 in the villa. The sun’s blazing, the pool is calling, and some islanders are getting closer… while others are sharpening their knives.”*

---

### **Morning Banter**

* Nic: *“So… are we gonna pretend Kenny isn’t stirring the pot every five minutes?”*

* Kenny (smirking): *“I don’t stir, I season. Big difference.”*

* Serena (whispering to Leah): *“This is about to blow up, isn’t it?”*

---

### **Ariana Narration**

* *“Later that day, you finally get a chance for some alone time with one of the boys. But the villa gods don’t make it easy…”*

---

### **Math Gate \#3 (7 seconds)**

Ariana: *“Prove you’re sharp before you get cozy. What’s **8 × 7**? You’ve got seven seconds\!”*

* ✅ **Correct** → Ariana: *“Brains and beauty — impressive. Go on, take your pick for some alone time.”*

* ❌ **Wrong/Timeout** → Kenny cackles:

  * *“Romance? Forget it — she can’t even do basic sums.”*

  * (Drama \+3, romance opportunity blocked).

---

### **If Correct → Private Romance Moment**

Player chooses boy:

**Example: Nic**

* Nic (cheeky smile): *“Finally, just us. No Kenny. No drama… unless you want some.”*

* Player free-text reply → Nic adapts:

  * Flirty → *“Cheeky\! I like where this is going.”* (+Romance Nic \+2).

  * Cold → *“Ouch. Mixed signals, babe.”* (Romance Nic –1).

**Example: Rob**

* Rob (serious): *“Look, I don’t play games. If you’re here for me, prove it.”*

* Player free-text reply → Rob adapts:

  * Sincere → *“Alright then. Maybe you’re different.”* (+Romance Rob \+2).

  * Sarcastic → *“This isn’t funny. Don’t waste my time.”* (Romance Rob –1).

**Example: Miguel**

* Miguel (smirk): *“You know I’m irresistible. Admit it.”*

* Player free-text reply → Miguel adapts:

  * Playful → *“I knew it. Chemistry doesn’t lie.”* (+Romance Miguel \+2).

  * Dismissive → *“You’ll regret brushing me off.”* (Romance Miguel –1).

---

### **If Wrong → Ungated Catastrophic Options**

* “Honestly, none of you are my type.” → (Drama \+4, romance all boys –1).

* “Kenny’s actually fit though.” → (Drama \+5, Kenny smirks, boys furious).

Result:

* Kenny: *“Finally, someone with taste.”*

* Nic mutters: *“She’s a train wreck.”*

---

### **Evening Drama**

* Kenny pulls a boy aside (AI can adapt which boy the player has highest romance with):

  * *“Mate, she’s only using you. Everyone knows it.”*

* Boy’s reaction depends on loyalty meter:

  * High romance → defends you.

  * Low romance → doubts you, drama meter spikes.

---

### **Closing Narration (Day 3\)**

Ariana: *“As night falls, sparks are flying in more ways than one. Romance is blooming… but Kenny isn’t finished yet. Tomorrow could decide your fate in the villa.”*

---

## **🔑 Notes for Cursor**

* Day 3 introduces **private romance scenes** (math-gated).

* Player’s **typed replies** should be parsed for tone (flirty, sincere, sarcastic, dismissive) and islanders react accordingly.

* Wrong/ungated choices remain extreme and destructive.

* Kenny should actively undermine — pulling aside the boy with the *highest romance meter* to try and turn him.

* End of Day 3: persist updated **romance \+ drama** meters.
