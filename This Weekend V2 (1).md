# **📖 Day 1: Welcome to the Villa (Sample Script)**

### **Opening Narration (Ariana)**

* *“Welcome to the villa, babe\! The sun is shining, the pool is glistening, and drama is already brewing. Let’s see who you’ll meet first…”*

---

### **Meet the Boys (short intros)**

**Nic**:

* *“Oi, you alright? I’m Nic — bit cheeky, bit charming. People say I can talk my way out of anything… fancy testing that?”*

**Rob**:

* *“I’m Rob. Straightforward guy. I don’t like games — unless I’m winning them.”*

**Rory**:

* *“Wassup\! I’m Rory, class clown of the villa. Don’t expect me to be serious… unless it’s about food.”*

**Kai**:

* *“Hey, I’m Kai. I’m chill, maybe too chill… but trust me, I notice everything.”*

**Miguel**:

* *“Hola, I’m Miguel. I mix confidence with a smile — dangerous combo, yeah?”*

**Pepe**:

* *“I’m Pepe. Spanish, passionate, and maybe a little bit too competitive.”*

**Bryan**:

* *“Bryan here. Honest lad, but don’t cross me — I’ll remember.”*

**Kenny (villain)**:

* *“And I’m Kenny. Don’t get too comfortable. I’m not here to make friends.”*

---

### **Ariana Narration**

*“You mingle with the lads, trading smiles and small talk. But suddenly—your first villa challenge appears\!”*

---

### **Math Gate \#1 (7 seconds)**

Ariana: *“Quick\! What’s **7 × 6**? You’ve got 7 seconds\!”*

* ✅ **Correct** → Ariana: *“Sharp brain, babe\! You’ve unlocked the chance to pull one of the boys for a chat.”*

* ❌ **Wrong/Timeout** → Kenny smirks:

  * *“Seriously? Times tables got you flustered? Good luck lasting here…”*

  * (Drama \+2, skip romance choice).

---

### **If Correct → Choice: Who to Chat With?**

Options (good, flirty):

* Pull **Nic** for a cheeky laugh.

* Pull **Rob** for a serious convo.

* Pull **Miguel** for some smooth Spanish charm.

**Example Scene if Player Picks Nic**:

* Nic: *“So you picked me? Can’t say I blame ya. What’s your type then?”*

* **Player options (Math-unlocked):**

  * “Funny, confident guys like you.” (+Romance Nic \+1)

  * “Not sure yet, but you’re growing on me.” (+Romance Nic \+1)

---

### **If Wrong → Ungated “Bad” Choices (dramatic/funny, always negative)**

* “I think you all seem boring, actually.” (Drama \+3)

* “Honestly, I fancy Kenny.” (Drama \+4, loyalty drop with everyone).

Result:

* Kenny laughs: *“Finally, someone with taste.”*

* Nic whispers to Rob: *“She’s a lost cause, mate.”*

* Ariana narration: *“Ouch. Word spreads fast in the villa…”*

---

### **Closing Narration (Day 1\)**

Ariana: *“The sun sets on your first day in the villa. Some doors have opened… and others may have slammed shut. Tomorrow, the games really begin.”*

---

## **🔑 Notes for Cursor**

* Each boy has a **romance meter** that only increases with *math-gated good choices*.

* **Ungated choices** must always be **catastrophic** (drama spikes, loyalty plummets).

* Kenny interjects as the villain whenever you fail math or make bad choices.

* End of Day 1 should persist state (romance & drama) so Day 2 can build on it.
