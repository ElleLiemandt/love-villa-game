# **📖 Day 2: Rumors & Romance (Sample Script)**

### **Opening Narration (Ariana)**

* *“It’s Day 2 in the villa. The boys are laughing by the pool, the gossip’s already sizzling, and Kenny… well, Kenny looks way too pleased with himself.”*

---

### **Kenny Stirs Trouble**

* Kenny (smirking): *“So… did you hear what she said last night? Apparently she called Rob boring.”*

* Rob: *“Wait, what? Did you actually say that?”*

#### **Player Choice (Ungated – both terrible):**

* “Yeah, I did. You kinda are.” → (Drama \+3, Rob’s loyalty –2).

* “I didn’t say it… but maybe I thought it.” → (Drama \+4, everyone laughs at you, loyalty drop).

👉 Either way, Kenny grins while your drama points spike.

---

### **Ariana Narration**

* *“The tension lingers in the air… but you get another shot to prove yourself.”*

---

### **Math Gate \#2 (7 seconds)**

Ariana: *“Quick\! What’s **9 × 8**? Seven seconds, go\!”*

* ✅ **Correct** → Ariana: *“Nice save. You’ve earned a private chat with the boy of your choice.”*

* ❌ **Wrong/Timeout** → Kenny bursts out laughing:

  * *“Nine times what? She couldn’t count her own toes\!”*

  * (Drama \+2, romance chance blocked).

### **If Correct → Romance Scene (pick a boy)**

**Example: Nic**

* Nic (grinning): *“Alright, so you don’t think I’m boring. Good start. What’s really on your mind?”*

* Player can type her own flirty/funny response (AI adaptive).

* Nic reacts according to tone:

  * Sweet → *“You’re trouble, but I like it.”* (+Romance Nic \+1).

  * Awkward → *“Ha\! You’re proper weird. Not sure what to make of you yet.”*

**Example: Rob**

* Rob (serious): *“I don’t like rumors. Convince me you’re worth trusting.”*

* Player free-text response.

* Rob reacts in line with personality:

  * Sincere → *“Fair enough. You might be real after all.”* (+Romance Rob \+1).

  * Defensive → *“You’re dodging. I don’t rate that.”* (loyalty drop).

**Example: Miguel**

* Miguel (smooth): *“I knew you’d pick me. You can’t resist the charm.”*

* Player free-text response.

* Miguel reacts flirtatiously if matched, mocking if cold.

---

### **If Wrong → Ungated Negative Choices**

* “Honestly, I don’t trust any of you.” → (Drama \+3).

* “Kenny seems the only real one here.” → (Drama \+4, Kenny smirks, everyone else annoyed).

Result:

* Kenny: *“Finally, someone with sense.”*

* Leah (to others): *“She’s digging her own grave, isn’t she?”*

---

### **Closing Narration (Day 2\)**

Ariana: *“Night falls. Some of the boys are warming up to you… others are keeping their distance. But Kenny? He’s plotting his next move. Tomorrow could be make or break.”*

---

## **🔑 Notes for Cursor**

* Day 2 expands **romance**: math gate unlocks actual intimate chats.

* Player’s **free-text answers** should feed into adaptive dialogue (boys respond differently depending on personality \+ tone).

* **Ungated options** continue to always be destructive (drama spikes).

* Kenny should always escalate conflict after fails or bad picks.

* End of Day 2: save romance \+ drama meters for branching in Day 3\.
