# Day 1: Welcome to the Villa

Narration: Welcome to the villa, babe! The sun is shining, the pool is glistening, and drama is already brewing. Let's see who you'll meet first…

Nic: Oi, you alright? I'm Nic — bit cheeky, bit charming. People say I can talk my way out of anything… fancy testing that?

Rob: I'm Rob. Straightforward guy. I don't like games — unless I'm winning them.

Miguel: Hola, I'm Miguel. I mix confidence with a smile — dangerous combo, yeah?

Pepe: I'm Pepe. Spanish, passionate, and maybe a little bit too competitive.

Bryan: Bryan here. Honest lad, but don't cross me — I'll remember.

Kenny: And I'm Kenny. Don't get too comfortable. I'm not here to make friends.

# COUPLE_UP

Narration: You mingle with the lads, trading smiles and small talk. But suddenly—your first villa challenge appears!

Ariana: Quick! What's 7 × 6? You've got 7 seconds!
