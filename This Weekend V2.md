## **1\. Objective**

Create a replayable, drama-filled villa storyline where:

* The player romances **one of the male islanders** (Nic, Rob, Rory, Kai, Miguel, Pepe, Bryan, Kenny if she dares).

* **Kenny is the villain**, stirring conflict and drama.

* Every \~20 turns (10 back-and-forths) → a **fast math challenge** that unlocks a *good* path.

* All **non-math unlocked choices** are intentionally **terrible options** that cause massive drama, loyalty loss, and possibly early elimination.

---

## **2\. Story Arc (High-Level)**

### **Day 1: Welcome to the Villa**

* Ariana introduces the player.

* The player meets each male islander briefly.

* First math challenge → success lets her pick who to flirt with. Failure → forced into a negative choice (say something insulting, loyalty hit, drama spikes).

### **Day 2: Getting to Know Them**

* Player spends time with boys.

* Kenny interrupts with gossip.

* Non-math choices are **awful** (e.g., “Mock his looks” / “Admit you don’t remember his name”).

* Only by passing math challenge can the player unlock a positive romantic moment.

### **Day 3: Romance or Ruin**

* Private chat with chosen boy.

* Math challenge → success \= romantic scene (flirt, kiss).

* Failure \= humiliating roast, boy’s loyalty drops, Kenny gains influence.

### **Day 4: Firepit Drama**

* Gossip spreads (especially if drama points are high).

* Player’s past choices catch up.

* If drama meter ≥ 9, player gets booted.

* Otherwise → final math challenge before ceremony.

### **Day 5: Ending**

* **Romantic Ending**: High loyalty with chosen boy, low drama.

* **Drama Ending**: Drama ≥ 9 → dumped.

* **Kenny Ending**: Kenny manipulates enough people to oust you.

## **3\. Mechanics**

### **Turn Counter \+ Challenge**

* Every 20 turns → insert math challenge (random 1–10 multiplication, 7 seconds).

* Correct \= unlocks **good path** (romantic, positive).

* Wrong/timeout \= forced onto **bad path** (roast \+ huge drama spike).

### **Choices**

* **Math-gated choices**: Sweet, flirty, positive dialogue. Increases loyalty with chosen boy.

* **Ungated choices**: Comically bad. Always spike drama \+2 or more. Examples:

  * “Insult his outfit”

  * “Tell everyone you don’t trust them”

  * “Confess you fancy Kenny instead”

* These bad choices create replay chaos and increase the odds of early elimination.

### **Meters**

* **Romance (per boy)** → increases only through math-unlocked good choices.

* **Drama (global)** → skyrockets with bad choices.

* **Boot condition** → Drama ≥ 9 at firepit \= eliminated.

### **Kenny’s Role**

* Always villainous.

* Mocking lines when player fails math.

* Encourages other islanders to dump player.

* If player picks Kenny, storyline turns toxic quickly (funny fail ending).

## **4\. Success Criteria**

* Romance only possible with the boys.

* Math challenges \= only path to positive outcomes.

* All ungated choices \= extremely negative, high drama.

* Multiple endings: Romantic success, early boot, Kenny manipulation.

* Replayable: Player can try to win over different boys on different runs.
